# Book-Lending-Application
Lending a book from the library may not be as easy as it seems to be, especially during the examination times. Most of the students like to use library resources either for the academic text books or for the general purposes. <br>
The availability of a book at a right time when a student needs it can became a nightmare. That’s the reason why students lend the book for longer period of times, even though they don’t use the book for all the time they borrowed. This reduces both availability and efficiency of the book sharing system. University cannot constantly supply for the demand if a student lends the book for longer periods without utilizing it.<br>
Book Lending Application is a project mainly concentrated on providing a solution for this problem. This application enables friendly sharing system among the students and increases the availability of the book and reduces the pressure among the students. This system creates a platform among the students to sub-lend their books lent from the library for shorter periods of time. This assures the efficiency of the book sharing among the students. This can also help students who want to share their private collection of books to other students.<br>
